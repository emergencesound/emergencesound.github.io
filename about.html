            <h4>About My Studio.</h4>
            <p>Emergence Sound Recording House was created in 2009 and has moved around quite a bit since then. It is now located at 11 N. Serenity Way in Greenwood, IN 46142. Feel free to contact James Yates (Audio Engineer) at 317-460-1729 or james.yates3@gmail.com to schedule studio time, discuss mixing/mastering services, or set up a meet-and-greet.</p>
            <p>Emergence Sound specializes in recording, mixing, and mastering music. However, I also offer a number of digital sound editing services. If you have a Foley, voiceover, speech or live recording editing project that needs work, letâ€™s discuss!</p>
